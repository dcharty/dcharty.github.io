        <section class="about-text">
          <p>
            I am a technology enthusiast with a bachelors in Computer Science from UMBC. 
			I do everything from programming to architecture to database design to data analysis to server administration 
			to cyber security, to networking, etc. The list of things I can’t do would be shorter to list, 
			which is front end design. I love the puzzle that is figuring out cost-effective and efficient 
			ways of solving a client's problem. It is always a blast finding out new possible solutions for 
			a multitude of problems. For example, I was able to take my networking knowledge, programming knowledge, 
			and the windows cloud environment to create a CI/CD pipeline from one database to another 
			that were in completely different networks for free and without needing anyone to go into 
			the environment to make any changes. This saved months on getting an application into production. 
			This was just one of the many solutions I have created that have saved companies time and money.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am not going to ramble on about the other things I have done. 
			That is what my resume is for, and honestly I would rather have my work do the talking. 
			I really hope this site is able to showcase just how passionate and skilled I am with technology.

              <h4 class="h4 timeline-item-title">Senior Database Architect</h4>

              <span>October 2018 – Present</span>

              <p class="timeline-text">
                I am hired as a Senior Database Architect, but I have many roles. I assist with making technical decisions relating to work flow, efficiency, and adding new technologies into the environment. I create prototypes for people to test out new technology. I also write scripts to help streamline their work, and I maintain our groups Sharepoint website as well. My scripts has saved thousands of man hours over the past 3 years. Additionally, I leverage Splunk, Tanium, access, excel, and scripts to help assist with data analytics and information lookup. I also used Splunk to find network irregularities, vulnerability issues, and configuration issues to present to upper management.  I have made custom websites for clients, and created a custom made prototype of the organization’s ticketing system in ServiceNow.  They were made from the ground up in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. I used a few different libraries to help out including Bootstrap. Right now I am working on making multiple applications/websites in PowerApps to do data cleaning, information gathering, virtual voting, and data dashboards. I designed all of these applications and websites purely by myself. These responsibilities have included making the ETL pipeline between services and databases, making sure data is updated reliably and quickly, designing the front and backend, patching said applications, and doing all the testing.

              <span>March 2017 – June 2018</span>

              <p class="timeline-text">
                Although initially hired as a tester, I was quickly transferred to the Developmental Operations Division to work multiple projects.  I assist with new technology integration, build and initiate infrastructure for both hardware and software within the testing environment for Quality Assurance (QA), writing scripts to streamline QA testing, and identifying and mitigating issue areas within the test environment. For more specific examples, I wrote scripts to write more than half of the thousands of test cases we were given in a PDF file. It saved them a month worth of work hours using a 10 person team, since they were going to rewrite all those test cases manually into JIRA. I also did maintenance for the testing lab, and installations. This includes making sure the back-end was set up and ready to go.  I also had to make sure backups were set up in case anything went wrong to quickly fix things. I used imaging software, and database scripts for that. I also would do write ups for the more technical issues to send back to the programmers, and helped write automation test scripts in my free time.
